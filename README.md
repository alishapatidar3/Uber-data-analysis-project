# 🚖 Uber Ride Data Analysis & Visualization

This project explores and analyzes Uber ride data using Python libraries including **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns in user behavior and deliver actionable business insights for ride-hailing services.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Cleaned and preprocessed raw ride data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data types.
- Engineered features such as:
  - Ride duration
  - Booking hour
  - Day of the week
- Formatted time-based data and categorized ride types for analysis readiness.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Performed comprehensive EDA to extract user behavior trends.
- **Identified peak booking hours**, with demand surging during morning and evening commutes.
- Analyzed ride frequency by day and month to understand time-based demand.
- Compared ride category usage (e.g., UberX, Uber Black) to identify user preferences.
- Examined distance traveled to evaluate trip patterns and user mobility.

## 📈 Data Visualization

Used **Matplotlib** to visualize trends and findings:

- 📊 Bar plots: Booking frequency by hour and day
- 📉 Line charts: Monthly ride trends
- 🥧 Pie charts: Ride category popularity
- 📏 Histograms: Ride distance distribution
