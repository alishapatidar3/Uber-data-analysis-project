Uber Ride Data Analysis Analyzed Uber ride data to uncover user behavior trends such as peak booking times, top ride categories, and ride frequency by day/month. Cleaned and preprocessed data, handled missing values, and engineered features. Used Matplotlib to visualize key insights and identify actionable business patterns.

This project explores and analyzes Uber ride data using Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. The goal of the analysis is to uncover meaningful patterns and trends in user behavior that can provide actionable business insights for ride-hailing services.

**üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
The dataset was first cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and reliability of insights. This included:

Handling missing or inconsistent data entries
Removing duplicates and correcting data types
Performing feature engineering to derive new meaningful attributes such as ride duration, day of week, and hour of booking
Preparing the dataset for analysis by formatting time-based data and categorizing ride types

**üìä Exploratory Data Analysis**

Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify trends and user behavior patterns. 
Key findings included:

Peak Booking Hours: Identified the hours of the day when bookings are at their highest, highlighting morning and evening commute times as peak periods.
Most Popular Ride Categories: Compared usage across different Uber ride categories (e.g., UberX, Uber Black) to determine which options are most preferred by users.
Daily and Monthly Ride Trends: Analyzed ride frequency by day of the week and by month to understand demand fluctuations over time.
Distance Traveled: Examined the average and total miles traveled across categories and timeframes to assess user travel habits.

**üìà Data Visualization**
Matplotlib was used to visualize key metrics and trends. Charts and graphs were created to clearly communicate findings, including:

Bar plots for booking frequency by hour and day
Line charts showing monthly ride trends
Pie charts comparing category usage
Histograms of ride distances

**üîç Business Insights**
The analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing driver allocation, refining marketing strategies, and enhancing the overall user experience. 
Understanding peak times, ride category popularity, and trip lengths can help Uber make informed operational and strategic decisions.

This project highlights core data analysis skills including data wrangling, feature engineering, visualization, and insight generation using real-world transportation data.
